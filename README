Parse Trademarks
@author Aaron Harvey
@version 1.0

Parse trademarks accepts an xml that was downloaded from
http://www.google.com/googlebooks/uspto-trademarks-recent-applications.html

It parses the xml file, using simplexml, stores the relevant contents in a class
that implements a custom USPTO interface and extends a skeleton class (contains only a getter).
After the relevant pieces of information for each trademark application is extracted from the
xml file, an object is built and stored in an array.

Following the completion of XML parsing, the array of objects is converted into a JSON object which
is accessed by the index.html file through AJAX.  The index.html file then leverages jQuery to
build the output and jQuery UI to display the information in an easier to read format.
